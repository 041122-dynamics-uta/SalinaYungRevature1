The Good Life

Data & Logic:
Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.

1. Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy. = Pepper is NOT getting its ears scratched, taking a nap, or going for a walk
2. Neither Ginger nor Saber nor Bear is on a walk. = This leaves Nutmeg as the only dog who is on a walk
3. One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched. = Nutmeg is already on a walk, Pepper is NOT getting its ears scratched, so this leaves Ginger as the remaining spice name dog  who is getting it ears scratched
4. A dog not named for a spice is playing catch. = Saber and Bear are not spice names, one of them may be playing catch
5. Bear is getting some exercise. = Bear is playing catch, so Pepper is burying a chew toy, and Saber must enjoying the remaining activity of taking a nap
6. Therefore the dogs are doing the following activities:
Saber = taking a nap
Ginger = ears scratch
Nutmeg = going for a walk
Pepper = burying a chew toy
Bear = playing catch
