Presidents Day

Data:
George, William, John, Abe, and Millard have their birthdays on consecutive days, all between Monday and Friday.
George’s birthday is as many days before Millard’s and William’s is after Abe’s.
John is two days older than Abe.
Millard’s birthday is on Thursday.

Logic:
1. Millard is on Thursday
2. George is many days before Millard = Monday or Tuesday
3. William is after Abe = Abe cannot be Friday
4. John is two days older than Abe = Abe is not Thursday or Friday, therefore he must be on Wednesday to leave two days for John, and John must be on Monday
5. This leaves George the only option remaining, which is Tuesday
6. Therefore birthdays from Monday to Friday: John, George, Abe, Millard, William
