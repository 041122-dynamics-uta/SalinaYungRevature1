Long and the Short of It

Data:
Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
Benito is not the shortest.
Charlotte

Logic:
1. Zina > Weldon > Delia = Weldon is second because he is shorter than Zina but taller than Delia
2. Weldon, Delia > Leisha > Benito = Leisha is shorter than Delia and Weldon, so she is fourth because Delia is third
3. Benito is currently last but he is not the shortest, so that leaves Charlotte as the shortest neighborhood child
4. Therefore from tallest to shortest:
Zina
Weldon
Delia
Leisha
Benito
Charlotte
